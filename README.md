H1B Visa Sponsorship Prediction

This repository contains the project files for the "H1B Visa Sponsorship Prediction" project. This project utilizes a dataset of over 33,000 job postings from LinkedIn to analyze and predict the likelihood of H1B visa sponsorship, focusing on various factors that influence an employer's decision to sponsor a visa.

Project Overview
The project involves a comprehensive analysis using machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression to determine the predictors that most significantly affect visa sponsorship decisions. The aim is to assist job seekers, particularly those needing visa sponsorship, in gauging the likelihood of obtaining sponsorship based on job posting characteristics.
